I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Calgary. My curiosity has driven me to explore various tech fields, from web design and databases to security, data analytics, and AI modeling.
While Iâ€™ve gained mid-level experience in these areas, Iâ€™m always eager to learn more and develop my skills further. Outside of tech, I enjoy sports and good conversations.
